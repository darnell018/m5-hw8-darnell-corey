This project was createed to complete an assignment for a University of Florida Course.

## Issues Completeing Assignment

I had a lot of issues completing this assignment. I'm not sure where or how to explain my issues. I've looked at the course material. I've watched the lectures. Are there resources else where to look for understanding JavaScript? I feel like i am falling behind in the course becasue I can't get a grasp on JavaScript.
